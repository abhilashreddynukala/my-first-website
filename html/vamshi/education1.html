</h3><p><b>ACADEMIC PROJECTS:
	<br>BURGULAR ALARAM:</br></b>
	Burglar alarms have become standard equipment in stores and other businesses, and<br> they're becoming 

increasingly common in private homes as well.</br> If you've ever shopped for a home security system, then you 

know there are a wide variety of options available. These systems range from do-it-yourself kits you can pick 

up for $10 to sophisticated whole-house security networks that must be installed by professionals.</br> But, as it 

turns out, most alarm systems are actually built around the same basic design concepts.
<br><b>SURVILLIANCE ROBOT:</br></b>
The main purpose of the robot we are making is to provide visual information of hard to access places, for example a building under a hostage situation.</br> 
Hence the main feature of our robot is an onboard video camera.</br>
Also the robot must be compact and self-contained in the sense it must have an onboard battery pack and wireless interface to the human controller.</br>
